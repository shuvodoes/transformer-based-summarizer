Streamlit library
Transformers library by Hugging Face
PyTorch (or TensorFlow) for running the model
You can install the required libraries by running the following commands:


pip install streamlit transformers torch
Note: The app uses PyTorch to run the T5 model. You can also use TensorFlow, but PyTorch is recommended for this app.
